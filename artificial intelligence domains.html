<h3> artificial intelligence engineering:</h3>Organizations are discovering the profound impact that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have on their business. Business analytics professionals are evolving their skills to become citizen data scientists, joining forces with traditional data scientists to build machine learning models that provide insight and recommendations about future decisions — decisions that were unfathomable just a few years ago. In order to truly become an AI-driven enterprise, an organization must embed AI into its applications so that everyone in the organization has access to insight and is empowered to make better, faster decisions.

AI-driven organizations are creating the role of AI engineer and staffing it with people who can perform a hybrid of data engineering, data science, and software development tasks. Unlike data engineers, AI engineers don’t write code to build scalable data pipelines and often don’t compete in Kaggle competitions. Instead, AI engineers extract data efficiently from a variety of sources, build and test their own machine learning models, and deploy those models using either embedded code or API calls to create AI-infused applications
 
 <h3>AI construction:</h3>

Artificial Neural Networks are used on projects to predict cost overruns based on factors such as project size, contract type and the competence level of project managers. Historical data such as planned start and end dates are used by predictive models to envision realistic timelines for future projects. AI helps staff remotely access real-life training material which helps them enhance their skills and knowledge quickly. This reduces the time taken to onboard new resources onto projects. As a result, project delivery is expedited


<h3> natural language processing:</h3>
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation.
<h3>AI gaming:</h3>

In video games, artificial intelligence (AI) is used to generate responsive, adaptive or intelligent behaviors primarily in non-player characters (NPCs) similar to human-like intelligence. Artificial intelligence has been an integral part of video games since their inception in the 1950s.AI in video games is a distinct subfield and differs from academic AI. It serves to improve the game-player experience rather than machine learning or decision making. During the golden age of arcade video games, the idea of AI opponents was largely popularized, which sported an increasing difficulty level, distinct movement patterns, and in-game events dependent on hash functions based on the player's input.[citation needed] Modern games often implement existing techniques such as pathfinding and decision trees to guide the actions of NPCs. AI is often used in mechanisms which are not immediately visible to the user, such as data mining and procedural-content generation
The term game AI  is used to refer to a broad set of algorithms that also include techniques from control theory, robotics, computer graphics and computer science in general, and so video game AI may often not constitute true AI in that such techniques do not necessarily facilitate computer learning or other standard criteria, only constituting automated computation or a predetermined and limited set of responses to a predetermined and limited set of inputs.
