<h3>Asset management:</h3>
AI’s ability to extract content from unstructured data using natural language processing, find subtle patterns in disparate data sets, and enable machine-to-human communication via chatbots, has multiple applications in asset management. Core use cases include investment strategy, portfolio construction, risk management and client service.

By augmenting or automating many of an asset manager’s tasks, AI enables asset managers to deliver to the mass affluent a degree of personalisation and service quality previously reserved for high net worth clients. Additionally, AI can decrease the cost of portfolio construction while improving quality – the era of the ‘robo-advisor’.

<h3>Investment strategy:</h3> AI can improve a firm’s investment strategy by synthesising its research and data, and incorporating broader data sets including unstructured information. Superior pattern recognition can then deliver better multi-objective optimisation. AI can balance a diverse range of inter-connected objectives (including fund deployment, risk and profitability) to enhance returns more effectively than rules-based systems.

<h3>Portfolio construction:</h3> AI tools can augment, and increasingly automate, an asset manager’s process of portfolio construction. AI – ‘robo-advisors’ – can analyse a client’s goals, and within a firm’s investment rules develop personalised, optimised portfolios at low cost and high speed.

<h3>Risk management:</h3> AI can improve risk management by incorporating broader data sets and improving analytical processing. 90% of data generated today is unstructured information, stored outside traditional databases (International Data Group). Natural language processing enables additional data sets to be incorporated into firms’ analyses. Other AI techniques, including deep learning, then enable patterns in data to be identified with greater granularity and confidence. Together, these capabilities enable risks to be identified and quantified more effectively.

<h3>Client service:</h3> Chatbot interfaces are being applied within and beyond asset management firms. Deployed in clientfacing channels, natural language systems enable client enrolment, support and self-service. Embedded in internal tools, chatbots let account managers query client details and  understand developments relevant to a client’s portfolio in seconds instead of minutes. Fewer account managers can then provide a higher quality service to a greater number of clients.

<h3>Healthcare:</h3>

In the next decade, AI can unlock a paradigm shift in healthcare to improve patient care and process efficiency. Automated diagnosis was an early use case for rudimentary AI in the 1980s. ‘Expert systems’ mimicked human approaches to diagnosis, applying rules-based inferences to bodies of knowledge. Modern AI, particularly deep learning, is more effective and applicable to a wider range of processes. Key use cases include diagnosis, drug discovery and patient monitoring.
AI can be used extensively in the healthcare industry. It is applicable in automated operations, predictive diagnostics, preventive interventions, precision surgery, and a host of other clinical operations. Some individuals predict that AI will completely reshape the healthcare landscape for the better.
AI is revolutionizing how the health sector works by reducing spending and improve patient outcomes.
And here are some of the applications of artificial intelligence in healthcare:

  <li>Doing repetitive jobs.</li>
  <li>Managing medical records and other data.</li>
  <li>Digital consultation.</li>
 <li>Treatment design.</li>
  <li>Medical management.</li>
  <li>Virtual nurses.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Diagnosis:</h3> Deep learning systems can replace complex, human-coded sets of probabilistic rules and identify subtle correlations between vast, multi-variate data sets to deliver scalable, automated diagnosis. While systems are nascent, accuracy is improving rapidly. Separately, computer vision solutions powered by deep learning are transforming diagnostic imaging. While human radiologists require extensive expertise and years of training to identify abnormalities in magnetic resonance images and ultrasounds, deep learning systems trained on large data sets deliver impressive results. Diagnostic imaging, powered by deep learning, now offers human-level accuracy and high speed in select contexts.

<h3>Drug discovery:</h3> Today’s drug discovery process is lengthy, averaging 12 years to market (California Biomedical Research Association). Expense and uncertainty are also prohibitive; drug development costs an average of $359m and just 2% of US preclinical drugs are approved for human use (California Biomedical Research Association). AI is being applied to multiple stages of the drug development process to accelerate time to market and reduce uncertainty. AI is being applied to synthesise information and offer hypotheses from the 10,000 research papers published daily, predict how compounds will behave from an earlier stage of the testing process, and identify patients for clinical trials

<h3>Artificial Intelligence will revolutionize agriculture:</h3>AI is also used in the agriculture industry extensively. Robots can be used to plant seeds, fertilized crops and administer pesticides, among a lot of other uses. Farmers can use a drone to monitor the cultivation of crops and also collect data for analysis.

The value-add data will be used to increase the final output. How? The data collected is analyzed by AI on such variables as crop health and soil conditions, boosting final production, and it can also be used in harvesting, especially for crops that are difficult to gather.

Artificial Intelligence will eliminate the need for you to perform tedious tasks.
AI is changing the workplace, and there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic. It is used to do lots of tedious and lengthy tasks, especially the low-skilled types of jobs that are labor-intensive. It means that employees will be retasked away from boring jobs and bring significant and positive change in the workplace.

For instance, artificial intelligence is used in the automotive industry to do repetitive tasks such as performing a routine operation in the assembly line, for example. Allowing a robot to care for well, robotic-tasks, has created a shift in the workforce.
